# Tasks for this upadte

- [ ]   consider creating a separate string type for parsed string (should help
        with comparisons of cases like "test" == 'test')
- [ ]   remove `playground.py`
- [ ]   rework list-likes copying from dangling rows (with new parenting to a row
        should be pretty trivial)
- [ ]   refactor `scripts/docs_tests.py` to only operate on examples, doc tests
        are handled by sphinx.
